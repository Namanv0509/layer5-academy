Learn how to start transforming your organization using the principles and practices of DevOps.

As Agile practices started revolutionizing software development, there has been an increasing need to bridge the gap between faster development and traditional waterfall practices. With its modern principles, practices and an array of state-of-the-art automation tools, DevOps provides a path to bring your operations into the Agile era, ultimately resulting in faster software delivery, without compromising on quality. The 2018 Open Source Jobs Report from Dice and the Linux Foundation highlighted the strong popularity of DevOps practices, along with cloud and container technologies. DevOps skills are in high demand, and DevOps jobs are among the highest-paid tech jobs.

As DevOps processes mature, there is a growing need for professionals with expertise in key practices and tools. DevOps has not only opened up new opportunities for Operations personnel but also provides them with a logical career progression. There is also an emergence of Site Reliability Engineering as a specific job description. This course has been designed as a first step in the journey of transforming operations personnel into an all-round DevOps expert.

By the end of this course, youâ€™ll know:

- How DevOps is influencing software delivery and why it is important for IT operations personnel to skill up with DevOps practices
- How Cloud Computing has enabled organizations to rapidly build and deploy products and expand capacity
- How the open container ecosystem, with Kubernetes in the lead, is truly revolutionizing software delivery and what role an Operations Engineer plays in it
- The why, what and how of writing Infrastructure as Code
- The role played by Continuous Integration in software delivery
- What is Continuous Deployment and Continuous Delivery
- The role played by Observability systems, what to observe and why
You should expect to spend approximately 10-12 hours to complete this course. You have access to this course for 12 months from the date you registered, or until your subscription expires (whichever happens first).

The chapters in the course have been designed to build on one another. It is probably best to work through them in sequence; if you skip or only skim some chapters quickly, you may find there are topics being discussed you have not been exposed to yet. But this is all self-paced, you can always go back, thread your own path through the material, and return to exactly where you left off when you come back to start a new session. However, we still suggest you avoid long breaks in between periods of work, as learning will be faster and content retention improved.

At the end of each chapter, you will find a series of knowledge check questions. These questions were designed with one main goal in mind: to help you better comprehend the course content and reinforce what you have learned. The end-of-chapter knowledge check questions are not graded. However, at the end of the course, you will need to complete a final exam and achieve a score of 70% or higher to successfully complete the course.
