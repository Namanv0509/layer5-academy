### Class Forum
One great way to interact with peers taking this course is via the Class Forum. The forum can be used in the following ways:

- To introduce yourself to other peers taking this course.
- To discuss concepts, tools and technologies presented in this course, or related to the topics discussed in the course materials.
- To ask questions or report issues with hands-on exercises/quizzes or course content.
- To share resources and ideas related to DevOps and SRE.
- To learn about course updates.
The Class Forum will be reviewed periodically by the Linux Foundation staff, but it is primarily a community resource, not an 'ask the instructor' service.

### Customer support - questions about enrollment, your LF Account, etc.
If you have questions regarding your course enrollment, you can reach out to us via our [Support system](http://trainingsupport.linuxfoundation.org/). You will be required to login with your LF Account, which will help us to quickly locate your account and respond to your request. This will also allow you to track your support request through to resolution, and create an ongoing record of your support requests.

The Linux Foundation Education Customer Support system also offers enhanced functionality, such as:

- Knowledge Base Articles - to help you find a quick response to your commonly asked questions
- Service Request Forms - asking the right questions so that you can get the right answers.
