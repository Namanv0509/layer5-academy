When working on the lab exercises, please keep the following in mind:

- When accessing external URLs embedded in the PDF document below, always use right-click and open in a new tab or window. Attempting to open the URL by directly clicking on it will close your course window/tab.
- Depending on your PDF viewer, if you are cutting and pasting from the document, you may lose the original formatting. For example, underscores might disappear and be replaced by spaces. Therefore, you may need to manually edit the text. Always double-check that the pasted text is correct.
