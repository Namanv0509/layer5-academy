### Init container pattern

The Init container pattern is used to execute (often critical) setup tasks before the main application container starts. Unlike regular containers, init containers run to completion and then terminate, ensuring that preconditions for the main application are met. It is ideal for:

- Preparing configurations
- Loading secrets
- Verifying dependency availability
- Running database migrations

The init container ensures your application starts in a predictable, controlled environment without code modifications

### Ambassador pattern

An ambassador container provides Pod-local helper services that expose a simple way to access a network service. Typically, ambassador containers send network requests on behalf of an application container and handle challenges such as service discovery, peer identity verification, or encryption in transit. It is ideal when you need to:

- Offload client connectivity concerns
- Implement language-agnostic networking features
- Add security layers like TLS
- Create robust circuit breakers and retry mechanisms

### Configuration helper

A configuration helper sidecar dynamically provides configuration updates to an application, ensuring it always has access to the latest settings without disrupting the service. Often, the helper needs to provide an initial configuration before the application can start successfully. Use cases:

1. Fetching environment variables and secrets
2. Polling configuration changes
3. Decoupling configuration management from application logic

### Adapter pattern

An adapter (or sometimes fa√ßade) container enables interoperability between the main application container and external services. It does this by translating data formats, protocols, or APIs. It is ideal for:

1. Transforming legacy data formats
2. Bridging communication protocols
3. Facilitating integration between mismatched services
