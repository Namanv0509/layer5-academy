As cloud native architectures continue to evolve, Kubernetes has become the go-to platform for deploying complex, distributed systems. One of the most powerful yet nuanced design patterns in this ecosystem is the sidecar pattern. This technique enables developers to extend application functionality without requiring in-depth knowledge of the source code.


The microcourse provides an overview of multi-container Pods in Kubernetes, explaining how they enable closely coupled containers to share resources, such as storage and networking, within a single deployment unit. It highlights common patterns—such as sidecars, ambassadors, and adapters—and offers guidance on when and how to use multi-container Pods effectively in real-world applications.
